# The Fool's Dungeon
![Java CI](https://github.com/dthornton22/team-9-project-cs-321-01/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This Java project is built using [Ant](https://ant.apache.org).

- Use case walkthrough: The user will start the game and be prompted to enter their username. The game will then display basic instructions, the player's current score (which starts at 0), and a leaderboard of previous high scores. The player will appear on the map and begin progressing through the level. The player will encounter enemies and loot chests in the level. Once the player encounters an enemy, they must fight it. In the turn-based fight, the player can either deal damage or heal themself with a potion. Damage will be displayed by the health bars of both the player and enemy. Once the enemy is defeated, it will roll a loot drop, which will be displayed on screen; the player's score will also increase. The player will continue progressing through the level looking for enemies and loot until they find and defeat the boss. Defeating the boss ends the level. The final score and leaderboard will be displayed on the end screen after the boss is defeated.
