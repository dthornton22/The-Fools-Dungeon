the map is 1080x1080, represented by a 8x8 matrix
matrix for existing example:	{0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1}
				{1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}
				{1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0}
				{1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
				{1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1}
				{1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}
				{0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0} where 1 is a wall and 0 is open space
sprites are all 135x135, 1/64th the area of the map - they'll each fit inside a square. might wanna make items smaller but we'll see
